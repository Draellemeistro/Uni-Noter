> [!example] **[[MD (Message Digest)]]**
> - Developed by Ron Rivest
> - MD2, MD4, MD5 are **==VULNERABLE==**
> - MD6 relies on a different structure


> [!NOTE] **[[SHA (Security Hash Algorithm)]]**
> - Published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
> - **SHA-0**, **SHA-1** are **==VULNERABLE==**
> - **SHA-2** is **==SECURE SO FAR==**
> 	- Different names based on the size of the hash, e.g., **SHA-256** **SHA-512**
> - **SHA-3** relies on a different structure



> [!success] **[[Merkle–Damgård construction]]**
> **a method of building collision-resistant cryptographic hash functions** from collision-resistant one-way compression functions.
> - This construction was used in the design of many popular hash algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-2.
> - Even though the structure is the same, SHA2 and MD5 have **different compression function and block size.**
