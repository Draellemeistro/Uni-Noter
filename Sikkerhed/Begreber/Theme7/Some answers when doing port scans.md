When performing a port scan, you can receive various responses depending on the state of the port and the protocol (TCP or UDP) being used. Here are the common responses and their meanings:

### Summary of Potential Responses

| **Scan Type**         | **Open**                                          | **Closed**                            | **Filtered**                                                                   | **Open**    | **Filtered** |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| **TCP Connect**       | Three-way handshake completed (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) | RST packet                            | No response or ICMP error message                                              | N/A         |              |
| **TCP SYN**           | SYN-ACK packet                                    | RST packet                            | No response or ICMP error message                                              | No response |              |
| **TCP FIN/Xmas/Null** | No response                                       | RST packet                            | No response or ICMP error message                                              | No response |              |
| **UDP**               | Application-specific response or no response      | ICMP Type 3 Code 3 (port unreachable) | No response or ICMP Type 3 Code 13 (communication administratively prohibited) | No response |              |

### Conclusion

Port scanning responses vary based on the protocol and the network's security measures. Understanding these responses helps in accurately determining the state of network ports and planning further security assessments or mitigations accordingly.
### TCP Scanning Responses

1. **Open**
   - **Description**: The port is open and accepting connections.
   - **Response**: SYN-ACK (in a SYN scan), or a completed three-way handshake (in a TCP connect scan).
   - **Implication**: A service is listening on this port, and it can be further investigated.

2. **Closed**
   - **Description**: The port is accessible but no service is listening on it.
   - **Response**: RST (reset packet).
   - **Implication**: The port is reachable but not in use.

3. **Filtered**
   - **Description**: The port is protected by a firewall or other filtering device.
   - **Response**: No response, or ICMP Type 3 Code 13 (communication administratively prohibited).
   - **Implication**: The scanner cannot determine whether the port is open or closed due to filtering.

4. **Unfiltered**
   - **Description**: The port is accessible but the scan is inconclusive about its state.
   - **Response**: Responses that do not clearly indicate open or closed, or no response in certain scan types.
   - **Implication**: Further probing is needed to determine the port's status.

5. **Open|Filtered**
   - **Description**: The scanner cannot determine whether the port is open or filtered.
   - **Response**: No response in cases where both an open and a filtered port would give no reply.
   - **Implication**: The port might be open or filtered; additional scans or methods are needed to clarify.

6. **Closed|Filtered**
   - **Description**: Rarely used, indicating uncertainty between closed and filtered.
   - **Response**: No clear distinction from responses.
   - **Implication**: Similar to filtered; additional investigation required.

### UDP Scanning Responses

1. **Open**
   - **Description**: The port is open and a service is running.
   - **Response**: Often no response (as UDP is connectionless), or application-specific responses.
   - **Implication**: A service is likely running on this port, but absence of response can be ambiguous.

2. **Closed**
   - **Description**: The port is closed.
   - **Response**: ICMP Type 3 Code 3 (port unreachable message).
   - **Implication**: No service is listening on this port.

3. **Filtered**
   - **Description**: The port is blocked by a firewall or filtering device.
   - **Response**: No response or ICMP Type 3 Code 13 (communication administratively prohibited).
   - **Implication**: The port is not reachable; scanner cannot determine if it is open or closed.

4. **Open|Filtered**
   - **Description**: The scanner cannot determine if the port is open or filtered.
   - **Response**: No response, as both open and filtered ports might not reply.
   - **Implication**: The status is ambiguous; further scanning might be necessary.
