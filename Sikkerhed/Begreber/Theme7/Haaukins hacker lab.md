- Each person has his/her own virtual lab, with his/her own devices/computers.
- Easily accessed through a web browser
- Fully automated setup - teacher/facilitator chooses which challenges to include.

Each challenge contains a description. You need to find a flag, i.e. a code which will give you points. A flag looks like HKN{123ABC}, where 123ABC is different from flag to flag.
