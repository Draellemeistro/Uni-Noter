## Defining security

> [!important] **Definition**
> **Computer security** refers to the protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the:
> - **integrity**, 
> - **availability** 
> - **confidentiality** 
>   
> of information system resources (includes hardware, software, firmware, information/data, and telecommunications)

**The security of a system**, application, or protocol is **ALWAYS RELATIVE** to:
- A set of **desired properties**
- An adversary with **specific capabilities**
## Three key security requirements: [[CIA triad]]

> [!NOTE] What is CIA?
> - **Confidentiality**: no disclosure to unauthorized entities
> - **Integrity**: no modification by unauthorized entities
> - **Availability**: authorized users can always access the system

## Other Security requirements
- **Non-repudiation:** A user cannot deny having used a certain service. A person who owns the data has no way to convince other people that he or she does not own it
- **Authentication:** The communication parties should be able to verify that ==the identity== of the other party is indeed the one claimed.
- **Authenticity:** property of being genuine, being able to be verified. Can be seen as ==authentication + integrity==
- **Privacy/Anonymity:** Personal information (including own identity) should not be revealed
- **Accountability** (includes non-repudiation): actions can be traced to responsible parties
- **Legal requirements:** Country specific legal security requirements (e.g. Legal interception, etc.)
