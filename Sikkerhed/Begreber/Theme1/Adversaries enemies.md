# Know the enemy
- Important to understand risks
- What are the motivations of different groups of hackers?
- What are their capabilities?
- What resources do they have available?

![[Pasted image 20240206100255.png]]
- [[insiders]] are often trusted employees with bad intentions. They often have privileged access and knowledge of relevant systems.
- [[Cyber criminals (Professionals)]] are often organized hacker groups and have a clear business approach to attacks.
- [[Script kiddies]] are beginners with limited knowledge and skills, often not fully aware of the consequences. Typically use tools or scripts found on the web.
- [[Gray hats]] are often skilled "hackers" without criminal intentions.
- [[Hacktivists]] are often motivated by ideology and/or politics, often working in groups across geographies. Often many members with very different skills.
- [[Nation-state actors]] are known to commit everything from industrial espionage to military activities to large scale destructive attacks.

## Motivations

> [!question] **Motivations**
> - **[[insiders]]:** Often revenge, e.g., in the form of sabotage but can also be motivated by profit, e.g., sharing or (mis)use of data from systems.
> - **[[Cyber criminals (Professionals)|professionals]]**: Money!
> - **[[Script kiddies]]:** Often just curiosity...
> - **[[Gray hats]]:** Curiosity or recognition, will rarely destroy.
> - **[[Hacktivists]]:** Often ideology/politics. Revenge is rarely motivation in itself.
> - **[[Nation-state actors]]:** Can be very diverse: Revenge, information gathering, strategic, military or political purposes.
## Capacities

> [!done] **Capacitites**
> - **[[insiders]]:** Often extensive knowledge of the company's systems, including vulnerabilities and inappropriateness. May also have knowledge/tools to hide activities.
>  - **[[Cyber criminals (Professionals)|professionals]]**:  Often a wide range of technical skills and knowledge, strong networks exist with the possibility of hiring specific skills – e.g., through underground network
>  - **[[Script kiddies]]:** Low technical competencies.
>  - **[[Gray hats]]:** Often highly specialized, can work together in networks.
>  - **[[Hacktivists]]:** Varies, but some of the groups have very skilled members among them.
>  - **[[Nation-state actors]]:** Many states have a significant presence in cyberspace and employ highly skilled people.

## Resources

> [!missing] **Resources**
> - **[[insiders]]:** Often works alone, but with system access.
>  - **[[Cyber criminals (Professionals)|professionals]]**: Plenty of resources in the form of money, equipment, and manpower
>  - **[[Script kiddies]]:** Limited resources, often work alone (rarely part of larger network).
>  - **[[Gray hats]]:** Often work alone (can be part of knowledge exchange network), but often quite capable.
>  - **[[Hacktivists]]:** Hard to say in general – some groups have many resources, including knowledge, manpower, access to botnets.
>  - **[[Nation-state actors]]:** Plenty of resources – money, manpower, knowledge, intelligence.
