## Phishing   
**Phishing** is a type of social engineering attack where attackers trick individuals to reveal   
sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal information.   
#### Examples of phishing attacks include:   
- **An email** that appears to be from a well-known bank or financial institution and asks the recipient to click on a link to update their account information. 
- **A fake login page** that appears to be from a popular social media site and requests users to enter their username and password.
- **A phone call** from someone claiming to be from a technical support team and asking for remote access to the recipient's computer to resolve an issue.
- **A fake job** offer that requires the recipient to provide sensitive information, such as their social security number or bank account information, as part of the application process.
