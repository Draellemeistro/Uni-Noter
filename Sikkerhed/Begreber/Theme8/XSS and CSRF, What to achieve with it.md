XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks aim to achieve different malicious objectives:

1. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**:
   - **Data Theft**: Attackers may exploit XSS vulnerabilities to steal sensitive information such as login credentials, session tokens, or personal data from users.
   - **Session Hijacking**: By injecting malicious scripts into web pages, attackers can hijack user sessions, impersonate legitimate users, and perform actions on their behalf.
   - **Phishing**: XSS attacks can be used to create convincing phishing pages that trick users into disclosing confidential information, such as passwords or financial details.
   - **Malware Distribution**: Attackers can inject malicious scripts that redirect users to websites hosting malware or initiate drive-by downloads to infect visitors' devices.

2. **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**:
   - **Unauthorized Actions**: Attackers aim to trick authenticated users into unwittingly performing actions on a web application, such as changing account settings, making transactions, or deleting data.
   - **Account Takeover**: CSRF attacks can lead to account takeover if the attacker can perform actions on behalf of the victim without their consent, such as changing passwords or email addresses.
   - **Data Manipulation**: Attackers may use CSRF to manipulate data within a web application, such as submitting fraudulent transactions, altering profile information, or posting unauthorized content.
   - **Data Theft**: CSRF attacks can be used to steal sensitive information from authenticated users by forcing them to execute requests that disclose confidential data, such as API tokens or personal details.

In summary, both XSS and CSRF attacks aim to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to achieve various malicious objectives, including data theft, session hijacking, phishing, account takeover, and data manipulation. It's essential for web developers and organizations to implement robust security measures to protect against these threats and safeguard the integrity and privacy of user data.
