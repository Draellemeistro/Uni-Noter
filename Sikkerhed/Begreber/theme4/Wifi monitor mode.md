# Steps to enable monitor mode in your virtual machine.
1. Insert the USB wifi adapter in your host machine.
2. To use USB devices in VM, you need to install Virtual Box Extension Pack on your host OS (not on the guest OS). https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
3. After installing the extension pack you selected the VM, go to Settings -> USB -> add USB filter, and in the list, select the USB WiFi adapter and OK.

#### Common Issues
1. If the host OS runs Linux (you have installed Virtual Box on Linux) then you have to add the user that starts Virtual Box to the **vboxusers** ==group==.
2. **If network manager is not running:**
	1. systemctl stop NetworkManager
	2. systemctl start NetworkManager
