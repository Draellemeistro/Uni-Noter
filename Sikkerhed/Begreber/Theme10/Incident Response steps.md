The diagram outlines the steps involved in an incident response process, divided into three main phases: Preparatory, Core Response, and Close Down. Here's a detailed explanation of each step:

### Preparatory Phase

1. **Triage**
   - **Assess Impact**: Evaluate the potential impact of the incident.
   - **Categorize Incident**: Determine the type and severity of the incident.
   - **Assign Incident Manager**: Appoint a person to manage the incident response.
   - **Check for False Positive**: Verify if the incident is genuine.
   - **Legal Input Needed?**: Determine if legal consultation is necessary.

2. **Escalate**
   - **If Required**: If the situation demands, escalate the incident to higher authorities.
   - **Within IR Team or to CIO/CISO**: Escalate within the Incident Response (IR) team or to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for further escalation.

3. **Kick Off Response**
   - **Who Else Needs to Be Involved?**: Identify additional parties that need to be involved, such as IT, legal, HR, or PR.
   - **Consider Internal and External Parties**: Ensure all relevant stakeholders are informed and engaged.

4. **Reporting**
   - **Consider Reporting and Evidence Capture Requirements**: Determine what needs to be reported and what evidence needs to be collected.
   - **Example in Case of a Data Breach**: Specific reporting requirements for data breaches should be considered.

### Core Response Phase

1. **Incident Management**
   - **As Required Throughout**: Incident management is an ongoing process, involving oversight, communication, support engagement, escalation, reporting, and notification.

2. **Analyze**
   - **Capture and Analyze Data/Information**: Collect and examine relevant data to understand the incident's nature and scope.

3. **Contain/Mitigate**
   - **Stop or Lower the Impact**: Implement measures to contain the incident and prevent further damage.
   - **Prevent Spread of Problems**: Take actions to ensure the problem does not spread.
   - **Consider the Potential Impact of All Actions**: Evaluate the potential consequences of containment measures.

4. **Remediate/Eradicate**
   - **Fully Remove/Stop the Incident**: Eliminate the cause of the incident.
   - **Confirm Successful Remediation**: Verify that the threat has been fully addressed.

5. **Recover**
   - **Recover Data and Systems**: Restore affected systems and data.
   - **Resume 'Business as Usual'**: Ensure that normal operations can resume.

6. **Resolve?**
   - **Is the Incident Resolved?**: Determine if the incident has been fully addressed. If not, loop back to earlier steps as needed.

### Close Down Phase

1. **Review and Close Down**
   - **Document and Assign Improvements**: Review the incident response process, document lessons learned, and implement improvements to prevent future incidents.

This structured approach ensures that incidents are handled efficiently and effectively, minimizing damage and facilitating quick recovery.
