ASIV is a relatively new and innovative credit card provider originating from the blockchain company Cryptobanker. ASIV was founded in the fall of 2021 and has in just one year grown from a small startup to a 10 million customer company. In particular, the company has marketed itself on guaranteeing user privacy and high uptime. Competing credit card providers such as VISA and Mastercard have in recent years experienced several scandals regarding sale of customer data, which ASIV has exploited aggressively in their marketing. ASIV’s strategic goal is to reach one billion customers by 2026. The company is headed by CEO Klaus Jacobsen, a 65-year-old entrepreneur and visionary, who is pushing hard to meet the goals of this ambitious growth strategy

ASIV is located in Herning. In order to achieve maximum control over customer data, these are stored at the company’s on-site datacenter. All data is RC4 encrypted. Initially, the storage system was setup and configured by the son of the CEO, Thomas Jacobsen. Thomas attends high school and has always had a keen interest in computers and especially gaming. Since then, the company has grown, and several consultants have been involved in expanding the IT-system. However, CEO Klaus Jacobsen thinks the Danish consulting firms have been overly expensive. Hence, utilized the services of various foreign consultants based in Russia, Ukraine, India and China etc., all of which have been doing an excellent job at a very competitive price.

The CEO has decided that there is a need for a dedicated IT department to ensure performance and uptime. Klaus Jacobsen has also heard of cyberattacks on the news and is unsure if this is something he should be concerned about. Today is the 15th of December 2022, you have been employed as the new IT department.

Your first task is to design a new cyberattack contingency plan. Consider the measures and strategies necessary to prevent / avoid attacks.

You have until 11.15 to come up with the plan (maximum of two pages).

In addition to the CEO, the company includes Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Lis Damgaard (35 years old, Msc(Econ.)), a 10-person financial department, a marketing department of 50 people headed by Hanne Iversen (30 years old, M.A.) who specializes in social media, and finally you representing the department of IT.
Most employees in the marketing department are hired part-time with a tendency towards a high turnover rate.

**Deadline: 11.15 at the latest. Hand in the contingency plan and recommended prevention / avoidance measures.**

You have until 10.25 to advice the CEO on whether to comply and pay the hackers. In your advice, please provide your recommendation and the reasoning behind.

**Deadline: 10.25.**


## (10.20) Log files problems
You receive a call from Thomas Jacobsen. He is observing that the servers are generating abnormally large log files, which makes the system run slowly. The slow response times mean that payments are starting to be rejected. Additionally, it is one of the busiest days of the year because of Christmas shopping. Thomas asks if he can delete the log files?

You have until 10:25 to provide an answer.

At the end of the conversation, you mention for him to check for ransomware on the servers, as you received a threatening email from the hackers.

**Deadline: 10.25. Answer either yes or no to delete the log files.**

## (10.30) The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority request
You receive a call from the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority. They want to know if you are in control of the situation in relation to the data leak. If not, they request you to stop all credit card payments. They are asking for a statement report before 10.45.

What will you write as a response? Do you recommend a complete shutdown of all credit card payments? You have until 10.45.

**Deadline: 10.45. Provide a statement on the grounds of your reasoning.**


## (10.35) The interview
After an intense online search, you have discovered the data that have been leaked from your servers. The data are stored on a server of an energy company that was hacked last week; it only took you a single call to the IT manager to have all the published data deleted. Additionally, you contacted True News to make sure they are not in possession of a copy of the leaked data.

Klaus Jacobsen comes by your office and asks you to stop everything you are doing. He was just asked for a live interview on today’s prime-time news. He expects critical questions in relation to cyberattacks. Among other things, he will be asked about how the current attack could happen? What the company has done to resolve the issue? If customers can be absolutely sure their data is protected, and it will not happen again?

Before 10.45 you must prepare notes for these interview questions for the CEO.

**Deadline: 10.45. Deliver the notes for the interview.**

## (10.40) Website defaced

**Nothing for you to report regarding this.**

## (10.50) Data loss reports
After a slightly chaotic interview, Klaus Jacobsen has gone on skiing holidays. However, as it turns out, strange things have happened at the data center, which has led to both the original and backup data being deleted. It looks like active actions by multiple users with administrator privileges is the culprit. The log files appear to be deleted, making it impossible to determine the scope of the problem and if the issue persists.

You unsuccessfully contact the CEO. Instead, you find and talk to CFO Lis Damgaard, who, to your surprise, is fully aware of the situation. “This was just waiting to happen” she says, continuing: “Now we must establish a comprehensive overview of the situation, so we can make the correct decisions going forward”.

Please answer the following three questions before 11.00.
1. What will you do to get a full overview of the situation after the latest developments?
2. What actions will you take immediately after the meeting and in which order?
3. Which internal as well as external people will you get involved in the further course of action?

**Deadline: 11.00**

## (10.55) Situation Normal
After a hectic course of action, you finally got the situation under control. Customers have demonstrated an understanding of the disruptions and everything is back to normal daily operation. However, the experience has been costly for the company, and the management is now perfectly aware that cybersecurity needs to be given higher priority in the future.

Finally, you have 15 minutes to consider what actions you will take to prepare the company against future cyberattacks. Please provide your three main points.

**Deadline: 11.10. And you don’t need to hand in the incident response plan or plan on how to handle the attack.**
