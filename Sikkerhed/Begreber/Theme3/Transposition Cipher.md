A transposition cipher is one in which **the order of characters is changed** to obscure the message.

## Example: 
Encrypt the message “**BUY SOME MILK AND EGGS**” using rows 5 characters long. 

**==Solution==**: We write the message in rows of 5 characters each. If the last row is not completed, we add nonsense characters to the end to complete the last row.

| Rows |
| ---- |
| BUYSO |
| MEMIL |
| KANDE |
| GGSPK |
==**Encrypted message**==: BMKG UEAG YMNS SIDP OLEK

### Lets try
CyberChef: [Caesar Box Cipher](<https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Caesar_Box_Cipher(4)>) 
Decrypt the message: **BMKG UEAG YMNS SIDP OLEK**
