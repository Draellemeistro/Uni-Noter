exchange public variables. combine with private variables(not shared with anyone) to create key together. 

two ends then exhcange their "key" or created public variable (some kind of mixing of an ends private variable with the public variable).
**so each end knows:**
- the public variable
- their own private variable
- the mixture variable of the others private variable and the public one. (TBF the mixture thing is in the public area)

they then take their own private variable together with the mixture. (think Alice and Bob. have private variables a and b. public variable g)
1. alice creates ag
2. bob creates bg
3. they give eachother the mixes (bob gets access to ag, alice to bg)
4. they can now use their private variables like so: 
	1. Alice: bga
	2. bob: agb
5. these new vars are private. have to be. for security
6.  new shared secret. sickness

## Lets try it: diffie-hellman.py

## VS [[Man-ln-The-Middle (MITM)]] attacks
1. Alice and Bob agree to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish a shared secret key
2. Alice generates a public-private key pair and sends her public key to Bob.
3. Bob generates a public-private key pair and sends his public key to Alice.
4. The attacker intercepts the communication between Alice and Bob and replaces Alice's public key with his own.
5. Bob receives the attacker's public key instead of Alice's and generates a shared secret key with it.
6. The attacker intercepts the communication between Bob and Alice and replaces Bob's public key with his own.
7. Alice receives the attacker's public key instead of Bob's and generates a shared secret key with it.
8. The attacker now has the shared secret keys generated by Alice and Bob, and can decrypt, modify, or inject [[messages]] into their communication.
