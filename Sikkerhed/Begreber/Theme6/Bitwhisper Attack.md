> [!question] What is Bitwhisper?
> **Covert Communication Through Thermal Channels**
> - A covert communication method for air-gapped computers.
> - Exploits thermal fluctuations to transmit data
> - requires no additional hardware

> [!example] How it Works:
> - One computer (*sender*) modulates CPU load to generate heat patterns
> - the other computer (*receiver*) monitors thermal sensors to detect patterns
> - Heat patterns encode data(*e.g., 0=cooler, 1=hotter*)
