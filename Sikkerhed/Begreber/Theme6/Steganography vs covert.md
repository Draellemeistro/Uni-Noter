Steganography and covert channels both involve hiding information, but they differ in their primary objectives and techniques:

1. **Objective**:
   - **Steganography**: The primary goal of steganography is to conceal the existence of hidden information. In steganography, the emphasis is on embedding data within a cover medium (such as an image, audio file, or text) in a way that is imperceptible to observers.
   - **Covert Channels**: Covert channels, on the other hand, focus on covert communication rather than concealment. The objective of covert channels is to establish hidden communication channels between entities (such as attackers and compromised systems) while avoiding detection or monitoring.

2. **Techniques**:
   - **Steganography**: Steganography typically involves embedding data within a cover medium using various techniques such as LSB (Least Significant Bit) replacement in images, spread spectrum techniques in audio signals, or modifying whitespace characters in text documents.
   - **Covert Channels**: Covert channels leverage existing communication channels or protocols in ways that were not intended or anticipated by system designers. This may involve exploiting timing delays, manipulating protocol headers, or using unused fields within network packets to covertly transmit data.

3. **Detection**:
   - **Steganography**: Detecting steganography often requires specialized tools or techniques designed to analyze and uncover hidden information within cover media. Suspicious patterns or anomalies in the cover medium may indicate the presence of hidden data, but detecting steganographic techniques can be challenging.
   - **Covert Channels**: Detecting covert channels typically involves monitoring network traffic, system logs, or other communication channels for signs of unauthorized or abnormal behavior. Anomalies such as unusual patterns of traffic, unexpected data transfers, or deviations from normal system behavior may indicate the presence of covert communication.

In summary, while both steganography and covert channels involve hiding information, they differ in their objectives and techniques. Steganography focuses on concealing the existence of hidden data within cover media, while covert channels are concerned with establishing hidden communication channels for covert communication purposes.
