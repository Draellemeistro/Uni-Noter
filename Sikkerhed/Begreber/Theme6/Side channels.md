# Side channels compared to Covert channels

> [!example] 
> **Covert Channel** is a communication channel that was not intended or designed to transfer information, typically leverage unusual methods for communication of information
> 
> **Side Channel** is similar to a covert channel, but the sender does not intend to communicate information to the receiver, rather sending (i.e., leaking) of information is a side effect of the implementation and the way the computer hardware or software is used.

**The difference between a side channel and covert channel depends on who controls the “*sender*”. 
==In a side channel, the “*sender*” in an unsuspecting victim and the “*receiver*” is the attacker**==

- **Means for transmitting information:**
	- Timing 
	- Power 
	- Thermal emanations 
	- Electro-magnetic (EM) emanations 
	- Acoustic emanations
