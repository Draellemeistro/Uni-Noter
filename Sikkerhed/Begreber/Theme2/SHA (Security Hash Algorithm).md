### SHA 1: Vulnerable
Uses [[Merkle–Damgård construction]]
2017: SHA-1's [[collision]]-resistance property was broken

### SHA 2: Secure so far
Uses [[Merkle–Damgård construction]]
#### SHA256
40 chars (not 256)
hexadecimal chars. 4 bits each 

### SHA 3: different structure. Waiting for SHA-2 to fail
