# Summary
##### Â two parts (1) Authentication and (2) Wireless Security. In the first part, we will briefly talk about symmetric authentication, asymmetric authentication, and digital signatures. In the second part, we will discuss main concepts and attacks in Wireless security.

# Begreber 
## [[Authentication]]
- [[Deauthentication Attack]] 
- Symmetric authentication
	- Basic protocol
- Message Authentication Code [[MAC]]
- Asymmetric Authentication (A.K.A. public-key based authentication)
	- Basic Protocol (with *nonce*)
- How does Digital Signature guarantee Authenticity?
	- The fundamental problem: [[Man-ln-The-Middle (MITM)]] attack
	- Digital Signature and Real Identity
- [[Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)]]
	- Registration and Certificate Authorities (RA and CA)
	- Digital Certificates

## [[Wireless Security]]
- **Wi-Fi: 802.11**
	- Beacon
	- Channel
	- Basic Service Set Identifier (**BSSID**)
	- Access Point (**AP**)
	- Station (**STA**)
	- Service Set Identifier (**SSID**)
- **Wi-Fi Security Options**
	- [[WEP]]
	- [[WPA]]
	- [[WPA2]]
	- [[WPA3]] 
- [[Wifi monitor mode]]
	- [[Sniffing WiFI Traffic]]
	- [[aircrack-ng]]
- [[Deauthentication Attack]]
