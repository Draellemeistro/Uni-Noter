# Summary
- Security requirements
- Different types of attacks ([[Ransomware]], [[Phishing]],**DDOS** [[Denial of Service (DoS)]], [[Supply Chain Attacks]]
- Examples of attacks
- Different groups of attackers (**motivation**, **abilities**, **resources**) See: [[Hacker Typer (Taxonomy)]]
# Defining security   
- ###### Computer security, information security, cybersecurity.   
	==**Computer security**== refers to the protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the **Integrity**, **availability** and **confidentiality** of information system resources (includes hardware, software, firmware, information/data, and telecommunications) [NIST Computer Security Handbook](https://www.davidsalomon.name/CompSec/auxiliary/handbook.pdf)   
 **The security of a system, application, or protocol is always relative to:**   
	• A set of desired properties   
	• An adversary with specific capabilities
**SE OGSA:** [[sikkerhedsbegreber]]
## Three key security requirements: C.I.A. Triad   
- **Confidentiality**: no disclosure to unauthorized entities   
- **Integrity**: no modification by unauthorized entities   
- **Availability**: authorized users can always access the system
## Other Security requirements   
- **Non**-**repudiation**: A user cannot deny having used a certain service. A person who owns the data has no way to convince other people that he or she does not own it.   
- **Authentication**: The communication parties should be able to verify that the identity of the other party is indeed the one claimed.   
- **Authenticity**: property of being genuine, being able to be verified. Can be seen as authentication + integrity   
- **Privacy**/**Anonymity**: Personal information (including own identity) should not be revealed.   
- **Accountability** (includes non-repudiation): actions can be traced to responsible parties   
- **Legal requirements**: Country specific legal security requirements (e.g. Legal interception, etc.)

# Understand the attack and the consequences   
- What are cyber attacks?   
- What is the threat like - right now?   
- Who will attack us and why?   
- Examples of attacks   
- What can we do about it? (and why it is important to know the attackers?)
## Security attacks: 
### Examples   
- **Active attacks**: involve some modifications of the data steam or the creation of a false stream   
	- Masquerade   
	- Modification of messages   
	- Denial of service   
- **Passive attacks**: are in the nature of eavesdropping on, or monitoring of exchanged packets   
	- Difficult to detect -> prevention, not detection   
	- Release of message contents 
	- Traffic analysis
### [[Common Attacks]]
[[Malware]]
[[Denial of Service (DoS)]]
[[Man-ln-The-Middle (MlTM)]]
[[Phishing]]
[[Ramsomware]]
[[Information theft]]
