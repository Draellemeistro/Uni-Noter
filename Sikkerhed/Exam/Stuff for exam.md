- **==go in-depth -> what problems -> how measures can help==**
	- **Intuitive understanding**
	- How it works
	- where to use it / why use it
	- How attack
	- consequences
	- how to prevent


## 1 cyber crime & various attackers
- Capabilities
- motivations
- differences
	- which aspect more powerful
- like the assignment
- 3 aspects==(?)== of security
- active/passive attacks + examples

## 2 hashing & PW cracking
- explain hash
- difficult(*? wrote diff*) to encrypt
- main properties
- Hashing algo examples
- coll. att. Hashing (*wtf did i abbreviate?*)
- Brute force attack on hashes
- **tools:** why connected to hashing?
- **salt:** why use it? How to use it? where to store salt?
- how to crack hashes?
	- what tools are there?
	- What do different tools/strategies require (password list etc.)
	- what is shadow file? How attackers use it?
	- countermeasures

## 3 encryption
- What is encryption & decryption?
	- different categorizations
- Stream cipher vs block cipher
- main properties of XOR
- Feistel high-level /intuition idea
	- What useful for/why building block
- caesar cipher: what, how work, how crack
- Symmetric vs asymmetric: Differences, where to use one over other etc.
- Diffie-Hellman: what does it do, Weaknesses, auth etc


## 4 auth + wireless security
- what replay
- auth purpose
- how verify
- simple, but fundamental protocols
- why important?
- logic behind
- diff. w. encr. (*difficulties? differences?*)
- Asymmetric vs symmetric Auth
- Digital signatures: why use? To guarantee what? core problem it solves?
- Protocols used:
	- Vulnerabilities and why
	- how to attack. What tools
	- Explain deauth. attacks
		- What allows us to do it, which feature do we abuse?
- Monitor mmode, what is, why need

## 5 attack & defense
- How/why set up safe enviroment to train
- what is backdoor attack
- back channel: what is, how works
- code injection: How use, how prevent
	- sql injection
	- how to perform the attacks
- What is xss
	- Cross-site req. forg.
	- What is goal
-  Which case hacker has control
- Cookies: How use, how defend
	- properties that can be misused
- Buffer overflow: what is, why it happens?
	- **==regular expr. examples(?)==**
		- Remember 3, when list (==???==)
		- why?: Like '*principles of software security*' **focus on what you think ==IMPORTANT==**

## 6 covert channels & steganography
- Covert channel: 
	- what is, 
	- example, 
	- how to use
	- differences to steganography
- tools, properties, features, methods, how to use methods
- techniques -> headers -> opt. fields
- timebused covert channels (==?????==)
- side channel
- covert channel trade-off between the 3 properties

## 7 network scanning & monitoring
- why network scan important?
	- why talk about it
	- features of different tools
- types of scanning (port, vuln.)
	- answers when do port scan, what are they
	- fully disclosed, stealthy
		- how remain stealthy
	- tool for scan, what arguments
		- we give IP, full scan/ half-open
- TCP/UDP
- Nmap

## 8 risk asssessment
- what is risk
- what is risk management
- types of risk assessment
	- qualitative
	- quantitative
- key properties of cyber security how define risks
- **==(5)==** impact & likelihood, where else to look
	- conf avail... (==????==)
	- Risk metrics
		- sammenhÃ¦ng
- ==**(8)**== Response -> how affects

## 9  incident response
-  incident response -> reaction when it happens
- differences to risk assessment
- why need both / why not need both
- include examples
- contingency planning vs incedent response plan
- NIST framework
- triage (**there was more to this, but i didn't get the word**)
	- how define security
	- escalation
