In order to completely describe the behavior of a r.v. an entire function – the cdf or pdf/pmf – must be given. In some situations we are interested just in a few parameters that summarize the information provided by these functions.

For example, when a large collection of data is assembled, we are typically interested not in the individual numbers, but rather in a certain quantities such as the average.

## [[Expectation]]
Expectation = expected value = mean = mean value
## [[Variance]]
