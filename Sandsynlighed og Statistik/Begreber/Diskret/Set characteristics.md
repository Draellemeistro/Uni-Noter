> [!set] 
> A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects, called elements or members of the set. A set is said to contain its elements. We write a e A to denote that a is an element of the set A. The notation a A denotes that a is not an element of the set A.

- Distinct = no repetitions
- Examples (roster notation):
	- {Saturday, Sunday}
	- B = {0,1}
	- C = {FCK,Mars,fish,$sqrt2$}
- Set builder notation
	- Includes properties that set elements should have
	- **example**: A = {month | no. of days in the month is less than 30}
- **Some important sets:**
