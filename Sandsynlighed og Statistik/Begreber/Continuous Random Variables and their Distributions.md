> [!NOTE] Definition
> X is a **continuous r.v.** if there exists a nonnegative function f(x), defined for all x having the property that for any set B of real numbers: $$P(XâˆˆB)=\int_{B}^{}  \, f(x)dx $$
> - Function f(x) is called the **[[Probability Density Function (PDF)]]** of X
> - additionally, f(x) should satisfly $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  \,f(x) dx=1$
> - Different probability statements can be expressed using pdf
> - **PROBABILITY THAT A CONTINUOUS R.V. WILL ASSUME ANY PARTICULAR VALUE IS ==ZERO!!==** (however it isn't zero for a really small interval, 
> 	  a la $P(X\in$ *small interval*$)=/= 0$)
> 	- if we let a=b, then: $$P(a\leq X\leq b)=\int_{a}^{b}  \,f(x) dx $$  $$P(X=a)=\int_{a}^{a}  \, f(x)dx=0 $$
