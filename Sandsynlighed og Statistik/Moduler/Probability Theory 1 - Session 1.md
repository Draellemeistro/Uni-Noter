## **What we learn:** 
The concept of the probability of a particular event of an experiment will be introduced by using [[probability axioms]]. Subsequently, the following topics will be covered: [[Sample Space]]. [[Events]]. [[Set Operations]]. Computing probabilities with counting methods. [[Conditional probability]]. [[Bayes formula]]. [[Independent events]].
## Literature:
[chapters 1](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter1/1_0_0_introduction.php) and [chapter 2](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter2/2_1_0_counting.php) from [PC](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/). Content of [Chapter 2](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter2/2_1_0_counting.php) is most probably familiar from high school math program.

- [[Set Operations]]
- [[Formula of total probability]] 
> [!Deterministic models]
> the conditions under which an experiment is carried out determine the exact outcome of the experiment

> [!Probabilistic models]
> the outcome varies in an unpredictable fashion when the experiment is repeated under the same conditions
