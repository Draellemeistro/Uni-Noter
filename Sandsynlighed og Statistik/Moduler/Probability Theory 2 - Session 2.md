Note that not all subchapters are equally important. Please look at the lecture slides to see what topics we have been talking about.
## What we learn:
The concept of a [[random variables]] will be introduced. Two types of [[random variables]] are considered: discrete and continuous. We will learn how random variables can be specified using pmf/ pdf.  Special attention is given to jointly distributed r.v.s and independent r.v.s. Expectation and variance is introduced as key characteristics of a r.v. behaviour.
