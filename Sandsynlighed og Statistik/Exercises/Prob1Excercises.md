#### (a) EF

#### (b) E $\bigcup$ FG

#### (c) EG$^C$ 

#### (d) EF$^C$ $\bigcup$ G

#### (e) E$^C$(F $\bigcup$ G)

#### (f) EG $\bigcup$ FG


# Problem 2
10 books are randomly placed on a shelf.
### How many distinct sequences of books are possible?

### How many distinct sequences of books are possible, if we know that two particular books of those ten books are placed next to each other?

# Problem 3
### Show that the probability that exactly one of the events E or F occurs is equal to $P(E)+P(F)-2P(EF)$
# Problem 4
A transmitter can send two messages A and B. Message A is sent with prob ability 084 and message B is sent with probability 016. Due to transmission errors, 1 6 of all sent messages of type A are received as message of type B. 1 8 of all sent messages of type B are received as message of type A.

### Find the probability that message $A$ is received;

### Find the probability that message $B$ is received;

### Message $A$ is received. Find the probability that message $A$ was sent.
# Problem 5
Show that $${n\choose r}={n \choose n-r} $$Now present a combinatorial argument for the foregoing by explaining why a choice of r items from a set of n is equivalent to a choice of n r items from the set.
# Problem 6
A basket contains 40 transistors: 5 of them are defective (= immediately fail when put in use); 10 are partially defective (fail after a couple of hours of use) and 25 are well functioning transistors. A transistor is chosen at random and put in use. If it does not fail immediately, what is the probability that it is acceptable?
