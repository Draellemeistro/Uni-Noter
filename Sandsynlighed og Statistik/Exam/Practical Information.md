# Literature
1) **H. Pishro-Nik, "Introduction to probability, statistics, and random processes"**, available at [https://www.probabilitycourse.com](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/) , Kappa Research LLC, 2014.  

This book is available as a hard copy, and it also can be found **online** at [https://www.probabilitycourse.com](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/) . The web-page contains also videos that are optional to watch or can be watch selectively in case a revisit of a certain topic is desired. 

2) Optional: if a hard copy book is desired, a book by Sheldon Ross can be recommended (any edition will do; not necessarily the latest )  

**Ross Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists.**   

Reading material is also specified for this book for each module. 

This book is not ordered to Factum Books (Reason: we can not estimate how many will want to buy this book and it can be easily found on all other sites with a short delivery time. Used copies of the book are also relatively easy to find)

3) Occasionally additional readings and videos will be provided for modules before the session (different online material; no purchase is required before the course start)

4) As an additional material, for the statistics part, we can recommend the book by Larry A. Wasserman "All of statistics: a concise course in statistical inference." There's only one copy at the AAU library but you don't need to buy it

# Academic content and conjunction with other modules/semesters
The course consists of two parts: the first part introduces concepts of probability theory and the second part deals with statistics. The course introduces very important mathematical principles that at the same time are very useful for engineers. From all branches of mathematics, this one is most probably the most useful for the computer engineers. The emphasis in the course is on understanding of the main approaches and their applications to real problems. The goal of the course is to provide students with the tools that can be applied e.g. in modelling of probabilistic system behaviour and statistical analysis of simulation and experimental results.

The detailed description of individual mini modules can be found on Moodle page of the course. The same number of modules (consisting of lectures, exercises and workshops) are planned for each part. The split between the two parts are 50/50. However, the parts are not independent, but the Statistics part is a natural continuation and builds upon the concepts of Probability. 

For each mini-module a detailed guidance is prepared explaining what should be done before coming to the class, during the class and after the class. Following this guideline will assist in learning the course topics.

Online available material is used as course literature. If you prefer to have a book that covers course material, a book by Sheldon Ross is recommended. It covers material of the whole course. Reading material for each module is also specified for this book.

The content of the course can be helpful in project work, especially when it comes to system performance evaluation and modelling.

# Scope and expected performance
The work load is expected to be 150 hours for a student. 

It is expected that students have looked at the literature belonging to each lecture before the actual lecture is given. Some lectures have pre-lecture exercises, that is, students are expected to solve some exercises before coming to the class. Each lecture is followed by an exercise session. Active participation in these sessions helps to understand the material presented during the lectures better.
# Module activities (course sessions etc.)
The probability part of the course is structured in the following way. The statistics part is structured in the same way. 

There will be 7 mini-modules for each part. Each Friday there will be a double lesson (2 mini-modules: from 8:15 until 16:00). Lecturing and exercise solving sessions will be interchanged, e.g. first 45 min of lecturing; then 30 min of exercises; then 30 min of lecturing; then 45 min of exercises etc. Smaller breaks and a lunch break are incorporated to allow to keep concentration. These classes are physical and we will have a lecture room for ourselves for the whole day, allowing us to stay in the room also while we are solving the exercises. This also ensures that the course-holder (Tatiana or Israel) are always present in the room and can assist immediately, also during solving of the exercises. The last mini-module of each part is a workshop. The workshops will be held in the form of extended exercise sessions. During the workshops the application of theory to real problems will become clearer. The workshops are hold online.
