You get a randomly selected question and are expected to give a brief lecture covering the central issues of itn. You can expect sub-questions related to the question.

Wireshark questions: You will be asked to **discuss a randomly selected Wireshark** lab based on the questions contained in the lab and the annotations of the **Wireshark** outputs (packet captures) that you did during the semester. **The exercises can be found at**: [http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/](http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/).
