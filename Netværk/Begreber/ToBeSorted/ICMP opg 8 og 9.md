### 1. Examination of the ICMP Error Packet

**ICMP Error Packet Fields:**
- **Type:** 11 (Time-to-live exceeded)
- **Code:** 0 (Time to live exceeded in transit)
- **Checksum:** 0xff4f (correct)
- **IP Header (of the original packet causing the error):**
  - **Version:** 4
  - **Header Length:** 20 bytes (5)
  - **Differentiated Services Field:** 0x00 (Default)
  - **Total Length:** 92
  - **Identification:** 0x882b (34859)
  - **Flags:** 0x0 (No flags set)
  - **Fragment Offset:** 0
  - **Time to Live (TTL):** 1 (Packet expired)
  - **Protocol:** 1 (ICMP)
  - **Header Checksum:** 0xd3f6 (unverified in this screenshot)
  - **Source Address:** 192.168.0.248
  - **Destination Address:** 143.89.12.134
- **Encapsulated ICMP Message (from the original packet):**
  - **Type:** 8 (Echo request)
  - **Code:** 0
  - **Checksum:** 0xff7c7 (unverified in this screenshot)
  - **Identifier:** 1 (0x0001)
  - **Sequence Number:** 14080 (0x3700)
  - **Data:** 64 bytes

**Additional Fields in ICMP Error Packet:**
- Contains the IP header of the original packet that caused the error (echo request in this case).
- Encapsulates the first 8 bytes of the original packetâ€™s data payload (ICMP echo request).

### 2. Examination of the Last Three ICMP Packets Received by the Source Host

**Last Three ICMP Packets:**
- **Type:** 0 (Echo reply)
- **Code:** 0
- **Checksum:** 0xffa9, 0xffa8, 0xffa7 (all correct)
- **Identifier:** 1 (0x0001)
- **Sequence Numbers:**
  - 85 (0x0055)
  - 86 (0x0056)
  - 87 (0x0057)
- **Response Time:** Approximately 277 to 282 ms
- **Data:** 64 bytes

**Differences from ICMP Error Packets:**
- **Functionality:**
  - The echo reply packets (Type 0) are direct responses to the echo request packets (Type 8) sent by the source host.
  - They confirm that the echo request reached the destination and the destination is responding.
- **Content:**
  - The echo reply packets do not contain additional encapsulated headers or payloads.
  - They are simple responses with a matching identifier and sequence number to the original echo request.
- **Usage:**
  - Echo requests and replies are used primarily for network diagnostics (e.g., `ping` command) to check reachability and measure round-trip time.
  - ICMP error messages (Type 11 in this case) are used to indicate issues like TTL expiration, helping in network troubleshooting (e.g., `traceroute`).

### Summary
- The ICMP error packet (Type 11) contains additional fields: the IP header and the first 8 bytes of the payload of the original packet that triggered the error, providing context for the error.
- The ICMP echo reply packets (Type 0) are simpler, containing only the identifier and sequence number from the corresponding echo request and the same data payload, with no additional encapsulated information. These replies confirm the receipt and response to the echo requests, while error packets provide diagnostic information about issues encountered during packet transmission.
