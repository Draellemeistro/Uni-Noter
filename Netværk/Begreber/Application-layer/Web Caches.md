> [!NOTE] TLDR: Web caches aka proxy servers
> **Goal:** 
> - Satisfy client requests without involving origin server.
> 	- Dont send object if browser has up-to-date cached version
> 
> **Reason:** 
> - Reduce response-time for client request (if cache is closer than server)
> - Reduce trafic on an institution's access link
> - "poor" content providers can more effectively deliver content, since **the internet is dense with caches**
