> [!NOTE] GOAL
> Determine “good” paths (equivalently, routes), from sending hosts to receiving host, through network of routers
> 
> **Path:** Sequence of routers packets travers from given initial source host to final destination
> 
> **"Good":** Least 'cost', 'fastest', 'least congested'
> 
> Routing: A 'top-10' networking challenge!
