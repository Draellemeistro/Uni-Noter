## Abstract
This unique book explains the basic issues of classical and modern **cryptography**, and provides a **self contained essential mathematical background in number theory**, **abstract algebra**, and **probability**â€”with surveys of relevant parts of complexity theory and other things. A user-friendly, down-to-earth tone presents concretely motivated introductions to these topics. ==More detailed chapter topics include== simple =ciphers=; applying ==ideas from probability==; ==substitutions==, ==transpositions==, ==permutations==; modern ==symmetric ciphers==; the integers; prime numbers; powers and roots modulo primes; ==powers and roots for composite moduli==; weakly multiplicative functions; quadratic symbols, quadratic reciprocity; pseudoprimes; groups; ==sketches of protocols==; rings, fields, polynomials; ==cyclotomic polynomials==, primitive roots; ==pseudo-random number generators==; ==proofs concerning pseudoprimality==; ==factorization attacks finite fields==; and elliptic curves. For personnel in computer security, system administration, and information systems.
