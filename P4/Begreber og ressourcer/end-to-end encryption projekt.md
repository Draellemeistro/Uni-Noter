> [!NOTE] #### Why E2EE?
> End-to-end encryption allows you **to keep control at all times,** when your data is in transit, when it is at rest, and even when it is not in your hand. Thus, it offers far wider protection than other encryption technologies (TLS, full-disk encryption, ...).

> Whenever you face a case where [**compliance**](https://hackernoon.com/60-stories-to-learn-about-compliance?ref=hackernoon.com) **is important** (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC-2,...) or where you have **sensitive data** (medical, defense,...), end-to-end encryption is a must-have.
