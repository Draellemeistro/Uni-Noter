- Encryption algorithm are designed and implemented for transmitted data over a network Skrevet i C
- ==RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)== og ==IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm)==
	- combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms
	- In addition, a special algorithm developed to generate the cryptographic key complexly and randomly.
-  **FUNDET**: an algorithm consisting of more than a partial algorithm has been adopted which has increased confidentiality and complexity and overcome the key distribution problem
	- Because the secret lies in the encryption key , there is a generating key possibility and changing it afar of system designer for ensure Secrecy and limitation of liability
- **FUNDET**: the suggestion of using RSA algorithm along with the IDEA algorithm is provided with improved security and advanced encryption efficiency. 
- **FUNDET**: it extended the key space without any extra running time, which can be considered to be promising in the field of information and communication technology today.
- **FUNDET**: the integration between the improved International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) and Rivest-ShamirAdleman (RSA) with two layers of protection, the first of which is the encryption with an improved (RSA) algorithm and the second increased confidentiality and complexity. 
- **FUNDET**:  in the future this method can developed by using 2 keys instead of 1 key in each algorithm and use 256 bit instead of 128 bit this will make the method more security.
	- The complications that mentioned used one key to encrypt many messages, but in this elaborate algorithm the key is changing permanently and randomly depending on the value selected from the key generation file where the key can changing in every massage which every massage has its own key

- Cybercrime schemes
- Internet frauds
##### Abstract
- This paper gives a **brief outline of categories of cybercrimes**. These crimes are **==categorized as==** crimes against **==individuals==**, **==property==**, **==organizations==** and **==governments==**.
- **Various Internet crime scheme are evaluated** and **behaviour of criminals to perform the cybercrimes has been analyzed.** 
- A critical evaluation of report of cybercrime complaints under IT Act 2000 has been presented.
- ==to prevent the cyber crimes, individuals and governments need to clearly understand the crime schemes in the cyberspace and the contemporary and continuing Internet trends and behaviours of these criminals. ==
	- the prime objective of the government is to prevent cyber attacks and to protect the country's critical infrastructure. It also focuses on reducing vulnerability to cyber attacks so as to reduce and minimize damage and recovery time. 
##### Categories of cybercrimes
- Cybercrime against individuals
- Cybercrime against property
- Cybercrime against government/organizations/society
##### Internet crime schemes
- **Type I Cybercriminals** – These include the hobby hackers or the politically motivated hackers who are hungry for recognition.
- **Type II Cybercriminals** – They are not hungry for recognition. These include the psychological perverts, financially motivated hackers or organized criminals.
- **Type III Cybercriminals** – These are the disgruntled or former employees seeking revenge.
##### Behaviours in cyber crimes
The cybercriminals mentioned in “Internet crime schemes” section track information in many ways. In this section, the behaviour of the cybercriminals to perform cybercrimes is outlined.
-  In common fraud scams the criminals gathers the information by phishing and spoofing leading to identity theft. The imposter pretends to be the other person and uses their information without their knowledge to commit theft or fraud. Crimes related to health care, insurances are also performed by hacking and forging identities.
- Cyber harassment and defamation especially the cases of paedophiles and stalkers use false identities to trap the children and teenagers. Social media sites, chat rooms etc. are a major source for harassment and defamation.
-   Cybercrimes like the electronic spamming is the abuse of e-messaging system to send unsolicited bulk messages indiscriminately. In this overheads like the lost productivity and frauds are borne by the public and [Internet service providers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/internet-service-provider "Learn more about Internet service providers from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), who are then forced to add extra capacity to cope up with the deluge ([Spamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming)).
-   In cases like the frauds like auction frauds, non-delivery of existent/non-existent merchandize, the seller responds to the victim of the auction fraud and poses to be in a region outside the place indicating emergency leaving ([https://www.ic3.gov/crimeschemes.aspx](https://www.ic3.gov/crimeschemes.aspx)). The criminal steals this information from certain unsecured websites or by identity theft.
- Forgery is often achieved by hacking wherein the hacker attack the target computer and retrieve personal information of the victims and use it for their personal monetary gains. The Industrial spying/espionage are achieved through “spying”.
##### Cyber crime statistics
![[Pasted image 20240222165920.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240222165947.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240222165957.png]]
The graph indicates that out of the nine parameters under which the cases are registered, the perecentage variation of six parameter is negative. It implies that the cyber crime under six sub-citerias has declined. However the percentage increased in three parameters cannot be ignored as well. The worst hit is the hacking complaints. There is about 850% increase in the hacking complaints.

##### Conclusion
- It is the lack of cyber crime awareness that leads to cybercrimes. 
- [Information and communication technologies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/information-and-communication-technology "Learn more about Information and communication technologies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (ICTs); does not benefit to individuals, organizations and governments; but also widens the scope of criminal activities as well ([Srivastava, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213020916301537#bib0020)). 
- Presently, the credit card thefts and online money-laundering cases of cyber crimes are on the rise. 
- Harassment and defamation through social media are also a matter of concern to individuals. 
- Cyber-terrorism is the most prominent aspects of cyber crime across countries.
- The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) approved the National Cyber Security Policy in July 2013 that aims to create a secure computing environment in the country and build capacities to strengthen the current set up with focus on manpower training.
#### 2016: [End-to-End Encrypted Messaging Protocols: An Overview](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-45982-0_22)
This paper aims at giving an ==**overview of the different core protocols used for decentralized chat and email-oriented services.**== This work is **part of a survey of 30 projects focused on decentralized and/or end-to-end encrypted internet messaging,** currently conducted in the early stages of the H2020 CAPS project NEXTLEAP.

##### E-mail Protocols
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**
	- **PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)** was created to add end-to-end encryption capabilities to e-mail in 1991 by Phil Zimmerman
	- **OpenPGP** set of standards was finally defined in 1997, to allow the open implementation of PGP. **OpenPGP is implemented in open-source software such** as ==Thunderbird== with the ==Enigmail plug-in as== well as in mobile apps, such as the ==IPGMail== for iOS and the ==Openkeychain== key management system for Android and F-Droid.
- **S/MIME**: another IETF standard addressing the need for encrypting e-mail.
	- In contrast to PGP that is based on a decentralized “Web of Trust” between users who accept and sign each others keys.
	- S/MIME uses a centralized public key infrastructure to manage keys. Thus, while it has been adopted by some large centralized institutions, it has had much less success among the general public and so is not part of the study.
##### Chat Protocols
- [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/about/technology-overview/) (eXtensible Message and Presence Protocol)
	- traffic or content are not encrypted by default, although network-level encryption security using **SASL** and **TLS** has been built into the core.
	- **OTR (Off-the-Record) protocol** is an extension to **XMPP** to provide end-to-end encryption.
- Recently, a number of variations and alternatives to XMPP have been developed:
	- [Matrix.org](http://matrix.org/) designed as an “open specification for decentralized communication” using JSON rather than XML.
	- [Signal Protocol](https://signal.org/blog/pqxdh/#:~:text=The%20Signal%20Protocol%20is%20a,by%20Signal%20but%20well%20beyond.) ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol)), the non-federated protocol developed in 2013 by Open Whisper Systems, provides end-to-end encryption for groups.
		- Moxie Marlinspike, the co-author of Signal, was inspired with some OTR features, such as the idea of ephemeral key exchange
		- additional security features such as future secrecy, support for asynchronous messaging and group messaging
		- Signal Protocol uses the “**==Axolotl==**” **==key ratchet==** for initial key exchange and the ongoing renewal and maintenance of short-lived session keys, so there is not only no long-term key that can be compromised.
			- ==This provides forward secrecy so that the compromise of a short-term key does not compromise past keys (so that an adversary can decrypt past messages) as well as “backwards secrecy” (also called “future secrecy”) so that the compromise of a key does not endanger future messages. It could be a standard, but is not yet recognized as such.==
	- [OMEMO](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html) ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMEMO)) is a new encrypted extension of XMPP protocol developed in 2015 that effectively copies the Signal Protocol and adopts it to XMPP
##### Network-Level Anonymity
- There seems to be no functional standards on this level; however, some solutions, such as **[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)** or **[I2P](https://geti2p.net/en/)**, tend to serve as references for different projects.
- **[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)**
	- It is used by default by projects such as the **[Tor Messenger](https://blog.torproject.org/tor-messenger-beta-chat-over-tor-easily/)**, **[Pond](https://medium.com/@undercomm/secure-communication-pond-4985bfe85a2c)** and **[Ricochet](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_(software)>)**. (mere om [ToR messaging apps](https://blog.torproject.org/tor-heart-onion-messaging/))
	- Another example is the decentralized and ==end-to-end encrypted mobile messenger== [Briar](https://briarproject.org/) that relies on the **Tor** **network** when available, but could also work over Bluetooth in case of emergency off-the-grid situations.
	- Tor provides only anonymity for network addresses, but not metadata such as the sender, recipient, and time of message such as are kept in the email header in the time of email or can be deduced by the server
	- There has also historically been work on anonymous high-latency remailers to fix these transport meta-data leaks in federated messaging, falling under three types:
		-  **[Cypherpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk)** **[Anonymous Remailer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_remailer)**,
		- **[Mixmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixmaster_anonymous_remailer)**, 
		- **[Mixminion](https://www.mixminion.net/)**.
	- There has been a number of experimental tools developed on the network level that, while not guaranteeing anonymity, provide some level of encryption.
		- **[Zero Tier One](https://www.zerotier.com/)** is an end-to-end encrypted, peer-to-peer virtual network that provides static network addresses which remain stable even if the user changes physical WiFi/networks.
		- **[CJDNS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Cjdns)** ([mere info?](https://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/8ey0cz/what_is_cjdns_and_how_does_it_work/)) implements a virtual IPv6 network in which all packets are encrypted to the final recipient, using public key cryptography for network address allocation and a distributed hash table for routing.

##### Conclusions
This short paper presents a first exploration in this regard, especially peculiar from an interdisciplinary standpoint, inasmuch as it is elaborated by social scientists and is meant to serve their needs in the first place, as a pre-requisite to an in-depth, case study-based inquiry.

 this social science research is ultimately meant to feed back into the development of technical protocols – protocols that are not only technically sound, but made for users and able to find their way into networked societies that are increasingly concerned about the security and confidentiality of their online communications.

### Crypto stackexchange spørgsmål
[https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/43272/why-is-writing-your-own-encryption-discouraged](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/43272/why-is-writing-your-own-encryption-discouraged)

Your question, [MikeAzo's comment](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/52499/discussion-on-question-by-pierte-why-is-writing-your-own-encryption-discouraged), and [your reply](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/35015452#35015452) practically could not be a better example of [Schneier's Law](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/04/schneiers_law.html) in practice. Schneier stated:

Anyone, from the most clueless amateur to the best cryptographer, can create an algorithm that he himself can't break.

To answer your reply

How can you break it if I send you this "QTCPIGXKUXTGG" ciphertext encrypted by a merely a simple algorithm which you have no idea about how it was encrypted?

Because even though we might not know _exactly_ what your secret algorithm is, the first thing an attacker is going to reach for are common tools to attack [substitution ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher) or [polyalphabetic ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyalphabetic_cipher). Given even a few sentences of ciphertext is likely enough to fully recover every plaintext.

The fact that _you_ don't know how to break it is irrelevant. It's trivial to create a cipher that you yourself can't break, but it's another thing entirely to create a cipher that others can't break. And the odds that you are capable of doing it when you're not aware of even the most basic attacks against ciphers hundreds of years old — not to mention modern concepts like [indistinguishability under different attack models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_model) — puts you at an insurmountable disadvantage compared to ciphers designed by researchers with decades of experience in the field who are building off of modern notions of security and the discarded remains of thousands of failed ciphers that came before.

As an example, even if your cipher is somehow secure against a ciphertext-only attack (it's not), is it secure if I can trick you into encrypting a message of my choosing? What if I can trick you into decrypting a message of my choosing? What if I know part of or all of the plaintext for a particular encrypted message you've sent? What if you encrypt multiple messages with the same key? What if I can do any or all of these things hundreds or even millions of times in a row? These are all situations that are extremely common in the real world, and under which modern ciphers remain completely secure.

I'll leave you with another Schneier classic, [Memo to the Amateur Cipher Designer](https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/1998/1015.html#cipherdesign):

A cryptographer friend tells the story of an amateur who kept bothering him with the cipher he invented. The cryptographer would break the cipher, the amateur would make a change to "fix" it, and the cryptographer would break it again. This exchange went on a few times until the cryptographer became fed up. When the amateur visited him to hear what the cryptographer thought, the cryptographer put three envelopes face down on the table. "In each of these envelopes is an attack against your cipher. Take one and read it. Don't come back until you've discovered the other two attacks." The amateur was never heard from again.

So here's your first envelope: given a paragraph or two of ciphertext, your cipher will fail to language-based frequency analysis.

Let me know when you've figured out the other two attacks.

Edit: The comment about indistinguishability under different attack models is one reason why most "decipher this message crypto challenges" are [completely bunk](http://www.cryptofails.com/post/70546720222/telegrams-cryptanalysis-contest). They often simply give an attacker some ciphertext, ask them to decipher it, and declare victory when nobody produces the plaintext after some amount of time. Unfortunately that's not how crypto works in the real world; attackers have many more tricks up their sleeve in practice. They can trick computers into encrypting data of their choosing, they can trick computers into decrypting data of their choosing, and they can usually even do these things thousands, millions, or billions of times. [Moxie's post](https://moxie.org/blog/telegram-crypto-challenge/) shows how even the most terrible, horribly-designed, and obviously insecure ciphers can be effectively impervious when you restrict an attacker to a single [ciphertext-only attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext-only_attack), which aren't representative of attackers' capabilities against ciphers as they're actually deployed in practice.
