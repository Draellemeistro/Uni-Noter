This paper aims at giving an overview of the different core protocols used for decentralized chat and email-oriented services. This work is part of a survey of 30 projects focused on decentralized and/or end-to-end encrypted internet messaging, currently conducted in the early stages of the H2020 CAPS project NEXTLEAP.

The overview of the protocols presented in this short paper is focused on stabilizing a list of potential case studies among decentralized internet messaging projects. 

A further selection of these will be investigated in depth in the future with qualitative methods, including ethnography and in-depth interviews. 

This is deemed necessary as the proliferation of projects addressing encryption, decentralization, or both, in the field of messaging has not led so far to massive adoption outside of a few large centralized companies such as WhatsApp, for a number of factors that go beyond technology to include difficulty of use, economic sustainability, and unclear socio-legal status of encrypted communication. 

Thus, the development of a related Internet science requires insight from both social science and ICTs to understand the successes and failures in the design of end-to decentralized protocols.

Considering the lively and constantly-evolving ecosystem of standardized and non-standardized projects in the field of decentralized and encrypted messaging, it is important that a multi-year interdisciplinary effort such as NEXTLEAP starts with a comprehensive mapping of relevant protocols first, relevant projects applying them next, based on a defined range of criteria. 

This short paper presents a first exploration in this regard, especially peculiar from an interdisciplinary standpoint, inasmuch as it is elaborated by social scientists and is meant to serve their needs in the first place, as a pre-requisite to an in-depth, case study-based inquiry.

However, this social science research is ultimately meant to feed back into the development of technical protocols – protocols that are not only technically sound, but made for users and able to find their way into networked societies that are increasingly concerned about the security and confidentiality of their online communications.
