# ARP in action
**==example==** A wants to send datagram to B
- B's MAC address not in A's ARP table, so A uses ARP to find B's MAC address
1. A broadcasts ARP query, containing B's IP address
	1. ==**(destination MAC address set to all F's: FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF)**==
	2. all nodes on LAN receive ARP query
2. B replies to A with ARP response, giving its MAC address
3. A receives Bâ€™s reply, adds B entry into its local ARP table
4.
