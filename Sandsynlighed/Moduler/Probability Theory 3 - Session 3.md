# Special distributions
## Before:
make a quiz. If you have troubles answering these questions, please revisit the material of the first two lecture sessions.
## What we learn:
We will study certain types of distributions of random variables that occur again and again in different applications while constructing mathematical models of physical phenomena. We go through a number of well-known discrete and continuous random variables.  Every engineer should know them :)
