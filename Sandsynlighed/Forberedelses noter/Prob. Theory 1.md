# [1.2.0](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter1/1_2_0_review_set_theory.php) Review of Set Theory 
Probability theory uses the language of sets. As we will see later, probability is defined and calculated for sets. Thus, here we briefly review some basic concepts from set theory that are used in this book. We discuss set notations, definitions, and operations (such as intersections and unions). We then introduce countable and uncountable sets. Finally, we briefly discuss functions. This section may seem somewhat theoretical and thus less interesting than the rest of the book, but it lays the foundation for what is to come.

A **set** is a collection of some items (elements). We often use capital letters to denote a set. To define a set we can simply list all the elements in curly brackets, for example to define a set **A** that consists of the two elements **♣** and **♢**, we write **A={♣,♢}�={♣,♢}**. To say that **♢** belongs to **A**, we write **♢∈ A**, where "**∈**" is pronounced "belongs to." To say that an element does not belong to a set, we use ∉. For example, we may write **♡∉A.**

> [!NOTE] Set
> A **set** is a collection of things (elements).

Note that ordering does not matter, so the two sets {♣,♢} and {♢,♣} are equal. We often work with sets of numbers. Some important sets are given the following example.
