# Motivation 
The variations are given by r.v. $D=X-E[X]$. D can take on positive and negative values. We are only interested in magnitude ->we work with |D| or D^
# Definition
variance of r.v. X is defined as(using [[Expectation]]): $$Var(X)=E[(X-E(X))^2]$$
Which can be simplified to: $$Var(X)=E[X^2]- E[X]^2$$
## Another formula for variance

## Standard deviation of r.v. X is
$$Std(X)=\sqrt{Var(X)}$$
## Some useful identities concerning variances
$$Var(aX+b)= a^2 Var(X)$$
$$Var(b)= 0$$
$$Var(X+b)= Var(X)$$

# Covariance
## What does it show?
The covariance is an indicator of the relationship between two r. vs. and shows the joint variability of two r.vs.

If two variables tend to vary together (when one is above its expectation, then the other is also above its expectation), then covariance is positive. And negative otherwise.
## Definition
Covariance of 2 r.v. X and Y is defined by
$$Cov(X,Y)=E[(X-E[X]) (Y-E[Y])]$$
simplified to $$Cov(X,Y)=E[XY]-E[X]E[Y]$$

# Correlation coefficient
Instead of covariance, we can work with dimensionless quality:
Correlation coefficient of X and Y: $$Corr(X,Y) = \dfrac{Cov(X,Y)}{\sqrt{Var(X)}\sqrt{Var(Y)}}$$

Values of correlation coefficient lie between â€“1 and 1.
